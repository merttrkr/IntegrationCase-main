Latency: Acquiring and releasing locks may introduce small delays.

Complexity: The system becomes more complex, making debugging and monitoring more challenging.

Resource Usage: Requires additional infrastructure for Redis.

Time drift and clock synchronization issues: Redlock relies on accurate time measurements across multiple Redis nodes. 
If there is significant time drift between nodes, lock expirations may not be consistent, leading to potential safety issues such as race conditions or premature lock releases.
